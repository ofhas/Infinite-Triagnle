# Infinite-Triagnle
Just a simple sript that prints a trigangle over an infinite loop.


In thiss project we'll use the .replace method which enable to make changes on a string at a specific location at the string which we need to change.\
Because we need to remove a specific string from the last position of the string we'll have to make sure we'll use the array.replace(array[-1], ", 1) method.\
We need to make sure we tell our program exactly where to remove the sting and not just put the string in which we want to replace.\
We'll also use the time module to careate a delay between each pring so the user could see the triangle building in a normal way.

Finale result:\

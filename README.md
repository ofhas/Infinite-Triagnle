# Infinite-Triagnle
Just a simple script that prints a trigangle over an infinite loop.


In this project we'll use the .replace() method which enables to make changes on a string at a specific location of the string which we want to change.\
Because we need to remove a specific string from the last position of the string we'll have to make sure we'll use the array.replace(array[-1], ", 1) method.\
We need to make sure we tell our program exactly where to remove the sting and not just put the string in which we want to replace.\
We'll also use the time module to create a delay between each print so the user could see the triangle building in a normal way.
